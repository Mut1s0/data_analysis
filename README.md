Employee Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python libraries:

pandas → for loading, cleaning, and analyzing tabular data

matplotlib → for creating clear and informative visualizations

We use an Employee dataset (Employee.csv) to explore employee details, analyze trends, and visualize insights.

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore data from a CSV file

Perform basic data analysis (statistics, grouping, filtering)

Handle missing values where necessary

Create visualizations using matplotlib:

Line chart (trend over time)

Bar chart (comparisons across categories)

Histogram (distribution of values)

Scatter plot (relationship between variables)

📂 Project Structure
Employee_Data_Analysis/
│── Employee.csv          # Dataset used for analysis
│── analysis.py           # Main Python script with code
│── README.md             # Project documentation

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the files.

Ensure Employee.csv is in the same directory as analysis.py.

Run the Python script:

python analysis.py

📊 Tasks Implemented
1. Load & Explore Dataset

Loaded data from Employee.csv

Displayed first few rows with .head()

Checked data types and missing values

Cleaned missing values where necessary

2. Basic Data Analysis

Summary statistics with .describe()

Grouped employees by Department to find average Salary

Identified trends and patterns (e.g., salary differences across roles)

3. Data Visualizations
✅ Line Chart – Trend of Employee Salaries Over Index

Shows how salaries change across employee entries.

✅ Bar Chart – Average Salary per Department

Compares mean salaries across departments.

✅ Histogram – Age Distribution of Employees

Displays how employee ages are distributed.

✅ Scatter Plot – Salary vs. Age

Reveals relationship between employees’ age and salary.

📌 Error Handling

Checks if file exists before loading

Handles missing values gracefully

Catches exceptions during file read and plotting

🔮 Future Improvements

Use seaborn for prettier charts

Add more advanced analytics (e.g., correlation heatmaps)

Export results into a new CSV/Excel report

✨ Sample Insights (from Employee.csv)

Certain departments have higher average salaries

Younger employees are more common in entry-level roles

A clear relationship exists between age and salary growth
